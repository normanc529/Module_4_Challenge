# Module_4_Challenge

The goal of this program is to read through historic data on four "whale" funds and compared it
to the S&P 500 to check and analyze daily returns, volatility, risk in terms of variance 
covariance and betas.

What you can take away from this program is information to help one decide which fund to invest in
based on own risk adversity in correlation with the S&P 500 index.

libraries required and dependencies:

pandas
csv
numpy
pathlib

Part 1: import historical data via csv files provided

Part 2: quantatative analysis of performance and visualizations of daily returns of
        the four funds plus the S&P 500

Part 3: analyzing volatility in relation between the four funds and the S&P 500
        Using box plots to visualize fluctuations in data information and outliers
        
Part 4: Analyzing risk using standard deviations showing consistency of average returns on the 
        competing funds vs. the S&P 500
        
Part 5: Specific analysis of the profitable funds based on risk-reward Sharpe ratios

Part 6: Recommendations on how to diversify a portfolio vs. the S&P 500
        Using rolling averages on the profitable funds, show the ups and downs of each 
        fund considered good according to the Sharpe ratio based on the risk adversity of investors
